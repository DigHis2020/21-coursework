the practice file is cstmc-CSV-en 

so the data that you input into the df.read_csv("") line must end with a .csv
Exactly the file that appears in my file finder. 

When I tried to make the first graph
ERROR:bokeh.core.validation.check:E-1001 (BAD_COLUMN_NAME): Glyph refers to nonexistent column name. This could either be due to a misspelling or typo, or due to an expected column being missing. : key "x" value "TOTAL_TONS", key "y" value "AC_ATTACKING" [renderer: GlyphRenderer(id='1144', ...)]



artifact number did not work as an x variable 

model did, but it is enumerated



gonna try with an actual quantative graph now
