ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
nbclient 0.5.2 requires jupyter-client>=6.1.5, but you have jupyter-client 6.1.3 which is incompatible.
jupyter-server 1.4.0 requires tornado>=6.1.0, but you have tornado 6.0.4 which is incompatible.

This was the first error I found. 
Notebook still booted up so I guess its not a problem right now.
